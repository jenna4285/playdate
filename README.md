# PlayDate
  ## Description:
  Going to the playground is one of the highlights of childhood. The only thing better than being at the playground is being there when other kids are there to play with!
  
   The PlayDate app allows families to connect with their neighbors so that their kids can make new friends and play together! Check your dashboard to see where and when other families will be heading to a park or other location near you. You can include your planned activities so that others can join and enhance the fun for everyone.

   Simply create an account on PlayDate to get started. You can see global / neihborhood activities, add your own events, as well as add and message friends.
